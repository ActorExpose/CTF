This is a warmup web problem.

At line 7, we see that parse_str function is used without its second parameter, $result.
This causes parsed parameters to be saved as variables which are referred to as register globals.

Thus, by sending GET request as: http://simpleauth.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo?action=auth&hashed_password=c019f6e5cd8aa0bbbcc6e994a54c757e,
we are able to set $action = auth, $hashed_password = c019f6e5cd8aa0bbbcc6e994a54c757e, and with empty $user and $pass.
Since $user and $pass are empty, the value of $hashed_password is not overwritten with hash().
Then, we easily pass the checks at line 24, and gets the $flag printed out.
