This is a warmup web problem.

At line 7, we see that parse_str function is used without its second parameter, $result.
This results in parsed parameters being saved as variables in the current scope, which is considered as "register globals".

Thus, by sending GET request as: http://simpleauth.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo?action=auth&hashed_password=c019f6e5cd8aa0bbbcc6e994a54c757e, we are able to set the variables as we wish to and get the flag.
